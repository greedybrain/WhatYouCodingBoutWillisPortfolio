        nutshell: `Hello, my name is Naya Willis. I'm a very simple man. If I see, or write, code, I get excited and indulge even further (especially when it works ðŸ¤¯).\n\n

        I have a very strong curiosity and aptitude to learn new things. No matter how challenging it may seem; hours, days, weeks, or even months will have to be put into whatever it is that I'm learning until I fully comprehend it.\n\n
        
        Shameless plug: I can solve the Rubik's Cube in less than 2 minutes. Emphasis on me loving to challenge myself!`,
